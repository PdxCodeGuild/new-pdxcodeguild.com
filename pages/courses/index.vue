        <h3>Cost &amp; Financial Aid</h3>
        <p>
          PDX Code Guild works with a variety of organizations to provide
          financial aid for our students. Over half of our students have
          qualified for partial financial aid through the organizations we
          partner with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the criteria our partners use differ from organization to
          organization, we encourage you to complete your application as soon as
          possible so that our partners can start working with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          PDX Code Guild also offers a limited number of diversity discounts per
          class, based on merit and need, to women, people of color and people
          who are LGBTQ.
