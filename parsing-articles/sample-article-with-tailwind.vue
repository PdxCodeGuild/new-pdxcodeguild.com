      Heard mixed reviews? Deciding if this path is for you? This will clear it
      right up.<br /><br />What is a Coding Bootcamp?
    </h2>
    <!-- p -->
    <p class="my-4">
      A coding bootcamp is an intensive, technical program designed to teach
      programming skills that employers are looking for in a short amount of
      time. Coding boot camps are often attended by those with very little
      coding background who are interested in a career in tech. Tech jobs are in
      high demand, and extremely well paid, ranking in 8 of the top 15 jobs
      according to Glassdoor. After attending a good boot camp, students are
      equipped to apply for junior developer positions with a U.S. average
      salary of around $67,000 per year.

    <h2 class="text-3xl my-8">Are All Bootcamps Created Equal?</h2>
    <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">
      What difference does it make how I learn to code?
    </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="my-4">
      The three biggest differences between a programmer bootcamp and any other
      mode of learning to code are these&hellip;
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">1. Quality of programming skills gained</p>
    <p class="my-4">
      2. The amount of earning potential over the next few years
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      3. Your chances of finishing Bootcamps specialize in getting students
      skills fast so they can start high-paying careers in as little as 12
      weeks. Learning by other routes has an opportunity cost of missed wages
      and lost job experience while you are taking a longer, and often lest
      complete route to learn. Many students overestimate their self-discipline
      in self-paced programs and there&rsquo;s a much higher drop out rate.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="my-4"><strong class="text-xl">Online bootcamps</strong>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="my-4">
      There are two times online learning is most useful. It&rsquo;s great when
      someone is dabbling or learning what they can in preparation for a more
      robust course of learning, and when a programmer needs to brush up on some
      new syntax. Online courses will teach you mostly Syntax (the small
      differences in how each programming language is written) and you&rsquo;re
      going to learn how the code is written, but you&rsquo;re also going to
      have major gaps in important foundations. Working in teams simulates real
      work experience, problem solving under intense deadlines will also prepare
      you to manage the pressure that comes in this industry. We see so many
      students from online programs who take their time in self-paced programs,
      redoing the same problems over and over rather than adding to their stack.
      Many online bootcamps also make big promises, but be weary of ones that
      have &ldquo;guaranteed job placement&rdquo; or a &ldquo;money back
      guarantee.&rdquo; If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. While
      these are enticing offers, many of these guaranteed jobs are low paying
      and not expanding your skill set the way you&rsquo;re capable of. This
      will give you a platform to lead into tech, but for how much money you
      will spend and the amount of time it takes to get where you want to be may
      not be what you were expecting.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      <strong class="text-xl">Physical bootcamps</strong>&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      In the location you will be working from are often most recommended as
      there are many networking benefits by taking this route. A good programmer
      bootcamp like PDX Code Guild will have a strong, up-to-date curriculum
      taught in small groups by instructors with recent industry experience.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      The curriculum will focus on the individual student solving coding labs
      mixed with team and pair projects. Knowledgeable instructors should be
      able to keep each student challenged so that each student gets as much out
      of the bootcamp as possible and never has to wait for the rest of the
      class to catch up to them. It should stay at an intense learning curve
      most of the time.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl my-8">What Happens After the Camp Is Over?</h2>
    <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">
      How much can I make and what kinds of jobs can I get?
    </h3>
    <p class="my-4">
      If you take a programmer bootcamp, you can have skills for a high-paying
      job in 12-24 months. In Portland, PDX Code Guild graduates make between
      $45,000 and $95,000 in their first year on the job. Each year they work as
      a programmer, their earning power goes up. After two or three years in the
      field, a backend developer can make between $90,000 and $120,000 per year
      in Portland. With such a high demand for quality programmers, almost every
      graduate who wants a job will find one. Your interviewing skills and
      ability to articulate your knowledge can greatly affect the range in
      offers you receive, and many times it takes 3-4 months to find the right
      job. The jobs are really a mixed bag. You will be well situated for a job
      in web development. Lots of people end up in engineer positions where they
      help clients install integrate software into their products. Lots go into
      dev ops, deployment, taking care of servers, software testing, Q&amp;A
      positions, and IOT.

    <h2 class="text-3xl my-8">
      Computer Science Degree vs Programmer Bootcamp
    </h2>
    <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">What&rsquo;s the difference?</h3>
    <p class="my-4">
      If you were to go to university instead of a bootcamp, you may lose out on
      a significant amount of money. For the four &ndash; five years you would
      be in college, you may miss out on between $245,000 and $435,000 plus what
      you pay for tuition and student loan interest. University CS degree
      programs were designed to train researchers and not programmers. They tend
      to focus on theory and most CS degree graduates only take one semester of
      actual programming.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      At PDX Code Guild, we commonly hear from graduates of CS programs complain
      that they know a little bit of code, but don&rsquo;t know how to start a
      project, and don&rsquo;t know how to do all the bits and pieces you need
      to work as a programmer. Most bootcamp students already have a college
      degree, but if you don&rsquo;t, and you want to get one, you may consider
      going to a bootcamp, working as a programmer, save your money for school
      and go later without having to take out huge loans. You&rsquo;ll save a
      significant amount of interest and you may even be able to get your
      employer to pay for some of it.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <!-- strong -->
    <p><strong class="text-xl">Community College&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p class="my-4">
      Community college classes move slowly. You can learn in one week at
      bootcamp what will take you a whole term in college (community or
      university). At a community college you learn job skills piece by little
      piece and it can take a couple years to gain entry-level job skills.
      It&rsquo;s unlikely that you will get as strong as programming skills at a
      community college as you would in a good 12-week programmer bootcamp. Most
      technical classes at community colleges are designed to be transferred to
      a 4-year CS degree program or are for web development. In general you wont
      build the skills or portfolio you need for the higher-paying jobs at a
      community college, but if you find a good one, you will still lose
      approximately $100,000 - $165,000 in lost wages in the year and a half
      that you were studying longer than you would have been in a bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl my-8">Who Is It NOT Right For?</h2>
    <p class="my-4">
      If you don&rsquo;t like to program, this would be a bad career choice. If
      you are easily frustrated by puzzles, if you don&rsquo;t like to
      constantly learn new things, again not the best fit. Succeeding at a good
      bootcamp takes grit, determination and intrinsic motivation. Bootcamp is a
      very active learning environment and is best suited to hard-working,
      highly motivated students who can manage frustration, give themselves
      permission to make mistakes, and keep going. Bootcamp students who posses
      these qualities are rewarded with high-paying jobs in a field with
      excellent work conditions and often phenomenal benefits.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 class="text-3xl my-8">
      Choosing a bootcamp Bootcamps vary in quality.
    </h2>
    <p class="my-4">
      Look for bootcamps that are licensed. Avoid bootcamps with too much pair
      programming, classes led by teaching assistants or graduates of their own
      program with no experience working as a programmer, lectures given by
      video or have large class sizes. These programs tend to be more focused on
      making a buck than quality bootcamp education.
