          Technology is on an exponential scale of development that pushes the
          boundaries of what is known every day. Coding is no exception to this
          evolution and, here at PDX Code Guild, we keep up with the pace by
          teaching the most up-to-date versions and updates of any program or
          language.

          Our instructors are proven developers whose expertise falls within,
          and extends beyond, the scope of the curriculum. This allows our
          students tremendous flexibility when selecting capstone projects for
          themselves because they will receive support they need at any level of
          their development.

          Real world developers rarely work on a project alone. Here, we
          cultivate collaboration through group projects and code reviews. We
          also host coding meetups after work hours which is open to the general
          public to encourage networking: a necessary step in securing work for
          any field. Furthermore, we maintain an open door policy for all
          students and alumni where any individual can seek the support they
          need for tech challenges, projects and career guidance.

          Our students are individuals, not numbers on a page. We understand
          that each student has their own unique needs and talents. Maintaining
          smaller class sizes is essential to our mission to empower students to
          building a successful career in coding.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5 max-w-prose mx-auto text-base text-gray-500">
          We know that students will work harder on projects they are passionate
          about, so we ensure that capstone projects are tailored to studentsâ€™
          personal interests. This results in a strong, unique portfolio for
          each graduate which aids them break through the noise of other junior
          developers when applying for companies.
