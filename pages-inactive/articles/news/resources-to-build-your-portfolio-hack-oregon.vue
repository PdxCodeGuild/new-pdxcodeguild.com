        Alumni, recruiters, and teachers have each highlighted how important a
        portfolio is to getting hired. At a recent alumni event, I had the
        chance to talk to alums about resources they would recommend to build a
        portfolio in addition to the work that we do in class. Alums recommended
        Hack Oregon, Free Code Camp, and StartUp Weekend.

        Hack Oregon Mission Statement: Hack Oregon is a community-powered
        non-profit building civic data projects to promote engagement,
        awareness, and quality of life.

        What does participation look like: Hack Oregon &ldquo;tries to keep
        everyone&rsquo;s contribution between 5-10 hours per week. Part of that
        estimation includes pizza-fueled discussions during weekly in-person
        build sessions. If that&rsquo;s not a fit for you (maybe you&rsquo;re
        not local or have kids, or you just like to work alone) we can scale
        your participation to fit your lifestyle.&rdquo;
        http://www.hackoregon.org/what-to-expect/ Code Guild Alums recommend
        Hack Oregon because

        and

          >Aaron DeVore</a
        >
        liked being involved with Hack Oregon because it is an opportunity to
        make an impact. The project they worked on last year &ndash;
        Raiseeffect.org &ndash; was mentioned in the legislature and contributed
        to the conversation about raising the minimum wage in Oregon. They
        highlighted it as a good portfolio-builder for recent grads because it
        is open source, published on GitHub, and an opportunity to work on a
        team.
