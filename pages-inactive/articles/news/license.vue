      <h2 class="text-3xl my-8">What kind of license does Code Guild hold?</h2>

      <p class="my-4">
        Code Guild is licensed by the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating
        Commission.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl my-8">What is a license?</h2>

      <p class="my-4">
        Licensing is an intensive process managed by the Oregon Office of
        Private Postsecondary Education. It takes about a year to complete the
        licensing process. Career and vocational schools in Oregon are required
        to be licensed by the commission&rsquo;s Office of Private Postsecondary
        Education. The office is setup to protect student interests as education
        consumers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl my-8">Why is a license important?</h2>

      <p class="my-4">
        Code Guild is not in danger of being shut down. Licensed schools pay
        into a student tuition protection fund, which is available for students
        in the event of a school closure. Code Guild is eligible to accept
        scholarships and grants.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl my-8">
        Don&rsquo;t all code schools hold a license?
      </h2>

      <p class="my-4">
        Unfortunately, No. In fact, Portland Code School was not licensed and it
        did shut down unexpectedly. This left students without a clear path to
        graduate or get their tuition back. One way PDX Code Guild has
        demonstrated its commitment to delivering excellence in education is by
        becoming the only bootcamp in Oregon that has been operating legally
        since it&rsquo;s inception. All aspects of PDX Code Guild including
        operations, financials and everything pertaining to protecting the
        educational investment of the students are inspected by the state on a
        yearly basis. PDX Code Guild prides itself on putting the student first.
