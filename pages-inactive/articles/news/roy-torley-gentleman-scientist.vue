      <p class="my-4">
        Roy Torley is a current student in the night camp. At 64 years old, he
        has a PhD in Geology which &ndash; among other things &ndash; means that
        he can use the shape of a an individual grain of sand to determine where
        it comes from. So cool! Unfortunately, his PhD has not led to career
        stability. He has taught at various community colleges and started a
        tutoring business: Dr. Roy Torley, gentleman scientist. Eventually, he
        decided he needed to walk away from the ivory tower and get more
        real-world skills.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Roy chose Code Guild because it is well organized, because he was able
        to get a scholarship to attend, and because the teachers here were able
        to teach him a lot about modern programming. For Roy, the goal of
        attending Code Guild is &ldquo;to get a living wage job using skills and
        talents that I have. I want to enjoy a good long career with the
        security of a living wage.&rdquo; Even better, he looks forward to
        having more capacity to entertain and enjoy the good life.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        &ldquo;The older I get, the more social I become and the more I look for
        community.&rdquo; Passion for learning and knowledge Roy gets an
        expression of pure delight when he is talking about gaining knowledge.
        Learning and teaching are lifelong passions for Roy. Dating back as
        early as Kindergarten, Roy took it upon himself to teach the other kids.
        Looking towards the end of life, Roy said that &ldquo;Some people say
        that: He who dies with the most toys, wins. I disagree. Winning is
        having the most knowledge &ndash; his biggest toy!.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Experience of an older student I asked Roy what it is like to be the
        oldest student in the class. He was pretty nonchalant about it and said
        &ldquo;Age doesn&rsquo;t affect my experience as a student. I was the
        oldest student in my graduate years.&rdquo; Being in class with him, I
        can really see how his knowledge of older programming languages serves
        his learning process. Roy has the background to make connections between
        the modern programming languages we are learning and the larger
        programming discipline. The class as a whole benefits from Roy&rsquo;s
        understanding of the broader context of development and his willingness
        to step up to the whiteboard to teach the rest of us.
