        Earlier this week, we talked about what Github is and how it can be used
        as a tool to find a job. In this post, we are going to talk about how
        you can have a strong GitHub profile even as a beginning developer.

      <p class="my-4">
        The first things you post as a student will likely not be the best code
        you ever write. Post them anyway. As you learn, make changes to
        demonstrate how you are improving. Notes on why you made those changes
        will demonstrate how you think about your work.

      <p class="my-4">
        <strong class="text-xl">2) Keep your GitHub Green. </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        GitHub gives a &ldquo;green&rdquo; status to people who upload something
        daily. A green status is valuable because it demonstrates that you code
        daily which shows commitment. Pushing edits is okay &ndash; you
        don&rsquo;t necessarily need to push something new every day. A great
        way to keep your GitHub Green is by contributing to open source projects
        because it: Demonstrates an ability to collaborate. Can indicate a
        higher level of quality because the leader of the project will check
        code before integrating it. You don&rsquo;t have a personal project at
        the moment.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        <strong class="text-xl"
          >3) Ensure that your GitHub posts look clean.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Include a readme file and git ignoring files that shouldn&rsquo;t be
        included in the post. 4) Link to your GitHub from your LinkedIn profile,
        portfolio, and resume. This ensures that prospective employers and
        collaborators can find it easily. 5) Write clear commit messages.
        Include details about what you changed since the last commit that will
        be clear to you and fellow developers.
