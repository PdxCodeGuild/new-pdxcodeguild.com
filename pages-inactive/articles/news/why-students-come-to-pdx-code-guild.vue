      <p class="my-4">
        We recently asked our students why they chose PDX Code Guild. Our
        question comes from our belief that developers not only need to program
        eloquent solutions to coding challenges but also be able to communicate
        their thoughts clearly using the written word. We are working hard to
        not just make developers but people companies want on their teams. Read
        how Pat Farnach puts it eloquently all together&hellip; Although there
        are a lot of web development bootcamps out there, the decision
        wasn&rsquo;t too difficult for me.

      <p class="my-4">
        One of the main draws to the school was the fact PDX code guild teaches
        Python which is a very prevalent, flexible language that&rsquo;s used in
        and outside of web development. If I ever decide to go in an academic
        route, I&rsquo;ll be well prepared to work with research data. Or if I
        just want to write scripts to run on my computer, I can do that easily
        with Python. I&rsquo;m more interested in web development, but
        it&rsquo;s nice to have options. I also like that the school is in
        Portland, OR, which is a great city that just so happens to have a
        burgeoning tech scene. Finding a job after the class will be much easier
        than if I had gone to school in other cities. Coming from Upstate NY,
        the weather here doesn&rsquo;t really bother me, and there&rsquo;s no
        shortage of entertainment, good beer, and nature within arm&rsquo;s
        reach. Another thing that drew me to the school is the price. A lot,
        maybe most code schools, charge an exorbitant amount for 3-month classes
        with much higher student-to-teacher ratios. My class has 10 students, so
        that means we get a lot of one-on-one time with the teacher who really
        knows his stuff. So far I&rsquo;m really happy with my decision to come
        to Portland to take this class and I&rsquo;m excited to see where it
        takes me.
