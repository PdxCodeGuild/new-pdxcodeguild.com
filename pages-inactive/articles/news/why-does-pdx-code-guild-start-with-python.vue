        ôWhy start with Python?ö ItÆs a question we get asked over and over
        again. Why not teach another programming language like Ruby or Java? The
        answer is simple: It comes down to providing the best education for all
        of our students. At the beginning of the bootcamp, we use Python as a
        tool to teach the basics of programming because of its easy syntax and
        readability incomparable to any other language. Instead of focusing on
        training students in one specific language, we use Python to teach basic
        data types and transferable skills applicable to most languages to get
        them ready to enter the workforce as an entry-level developer û with the
        skills to easily pick up any language and excel at it. In addition to
        Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Django we also teach best practices
        and team skills found in most tech companies. We find that by the end of
        the bootcamp, your classmates are more like coworkers. This is achieved
        by using git and GitHub with group projects, pair programming, and
        personal projects as well as using scrum to organize and accomplish
        tasks as pairs, teams, and individual students. By the final week, with
        practical programming skills in some of the most popular languages, a
        unique capstone, and real-life industry practice, each individual
        student is prepared to be the best programmer they can be!
