        Code Guild&rsquo;s Alumni Network hosted their first event last month.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Graduates from each of Code Guild&rsquo;s graduating classes were
        invited. Students reconnected, played games, and talked about life after
        Code Guild. The Code Guild Alumni network was launched by and is
        entirely run by Code Guild alumni.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Alums willingness to step up and launch an alumni network really
        highlights that: Code Guild is a community. Alums are invested in their
        alumni network. Alums are putting effort into staying connected to Code
        Guild even after graduating and getting hired.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        An Alumni Network is valuable because it can help: Expand students and
        alums personal network. Help students and alums get jobs. Build the name
        recognition and the perceived value of the Code Guild experience. Code
        Guild Alums stay connected through a slack channel as well.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Typical topics on the Code Guild Alumni Slack Channel include: Job
        opportunities. Cool conferences and tech experiences. Updates about Code
        Guild happenings like graduation.
