        I was delighted to come across this review of PDX Code Guild on Course
        Report. The authorÆs experience differs from mine in terms of individual
        projects but really resonated in terms of class size, depth of material,
        and career support. ôI had a great experience at PDX Code Guild. I just
        completed their 4 month Evening FullStack Development Program, which
        covers Python, Javascript, CSS/HTML, SQL and Django. The program
        emphasizes quality over quantity of work, so in each section we learned
        the basics of the technology, completed a small instructor led project,
        and then completed a custom custom design project, with input and
        guidance from our instructor. The projects I worked on are as follows:
        Python: Todo list/Task Manager Weather Forecast App using forecast.io
        Mini HTTP Server HTML/CSS A personal portfolio website Javascript:
        Yahtzee Game E-Commerce Front end using AJAX to query product info SQL:
        A SQL back end for the E-Commerce Project Python/Django Blogging
        Platform Capstone Project (mine was a recipe engine that created a
        cocktail recipe book based on the ingredients you had on hand). The
        classes are small (max of 12), so you get a lot of time with your
        instructor, and they are able to go in depth into software design
        concepts and design patterns. They also offer advice and career
        guidance, help you organize your LinkedIn and Github and provide
        professional headshots. I worked full time (as many of my classmates
        did), and the hours were long. There is no homework, but I think that in
        order to get the best results, one should set aside the 4 month period
        for learning. I spent many nights and weekends perfecting my projects,
        and it paid off. I received a job offer the day after class finished
        from the #1 firm I wanted to work for. I have also been contacted by
        recruiters in other local tech firms based on the strength of my
        LinkedIn and portfolio. I accepted the offer, which was more than a 50%
        raise from my current position. Fair warning, PDX Code Guild advises
        that it typically takes 3-6 months for a student to find employment
        after completion, so YMMV. They also advised not to take offers under a
        certain level (IÆll leave it to the Code Guild to provide that
        information), and the offer I received was over the number they
        recommended. Over all I am very happy, and would definitely recommend
        PDX Code Guild.ö Alison Acuna
