        "Dearest Fear: Creativity and I are about to go on a road trip together.
        I understand you&rsquo;ll be joining us because you always do. I
        acknowledge that you believe you have an important job to do in my life
        and that you take your job seriously. Apparently, your job is to induce
        complete panic whenever I&rsquo;m about to do anything
        interesting&mdash;and, may I say, you are superb at your job. So by all
        means, keep doing your job, if you feel you must. But I will also be
        doing my job on this road trip, which is to work hard and stay focused."

        syndrome is the feeling that one doesn&rsquo;t deserve to be where they
        are in life.

      <p class="my-4">
        Imposter syndrome can manifest as the sense that you fooled someone into
        giving you the opportunity they did. It can appear as the deep sense
        that your success is more to do with luck than skill. It&rsquo;s
        estimated that 70% of people have imposter syndrome. People are more
        likely to experience imposter syndrome when they are feeling stretched.
        For example, when they are hustling a career change or learning
        something new. Attending a coding bootcamp can be a stretching
        experience. The experience of going from knowing very little about
        coding to knowing quite a bit about coding in a short period of time can
        be stretching. The experience of shifting one self-image to include
        developer can be stretching &ndash; especially if our cultural narrative
        suggested you might be better suited elsewhere.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Code Guild is designed to support students in overcoming imposter
        syndrome. Being a classroom environment is helpful because knowing
        we&rsquo;re not alone can be key to overcoming imposter syndrome. Code
        Guild specifically hires for teachers and TAs who are encouraging
        &ndash; who serve as cheerleaders as well as teachers. Code Guild
        promotes a diverse student body which helps me remember that people from
        any background &ndash; including mine &ndash; can be developers. I
        studied on my own for a few months before entering Code Guild. It is
        possible that I might have been able to teach myself everything I needed
        to know to be a developer. But I wouldn&rsquo;t have gotten over the
        imposter syndrome.
