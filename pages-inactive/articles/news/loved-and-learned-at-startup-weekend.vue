        Participating in StartUp Weekend Seattle: Data Science was one of the
        most fun and challenging parts of my time during Code Guild. StartUp
        Weekend is my kind of fun. The challenge is to build a startup û
        business plan, MVP, and pitch û in 54 hours. Loved: Being in a room with
        so many other hustlers. It takes a special kind of drive (or maybe a
        special kind of crazy?) to spend your weekend at StartUp Weekend. The
        people I met were driven, creative, energetic and so, so kind. Walking
        into a room and introducing myself as a developer. This was powerful! Up
        until this point, I introduced myself as a student. At StartUp weekend,
        I introduced myself as a developer û and nobody questioned me. It was a
        huge confidence boost as I prepare to start job hunting. Taking on a big
        project and testing myself. There were no teachers or tutors at StartUp
        Weekend. I ended being the only developer on my team. I wanted the
        challenge so I volunteered to create the website. . .by myself. . .in a
        weekend. It was incredibly satisfying to stretch myself and see what I
        can do. Learned: CodeGuild has taught me so, so much. To be clear, I
        knew going in that I had learned a ton during the bootcamp. I donÆt
        think I truly understood the complexity of what I had learned. At one
        point, some of my team members offered to help. I am pretty good at
        delegating and teaching so I figured I could quickly teach them some
        basic CSS and get their help on the front end while I continued to work
        on the backend. I could not. What I have learned through Code Guild is
        more complex and valuable than I realized. I have so much more to learn.
        There were times when I felt like an awkward, adorable adolescent
        labrador û you know that stage when their feet are too big for their
        body? That was me. I knew enough to create the website but am still
        learning best practices, efficiency tricks, and how to appropriately
        estimate project length. A ton about working with a team. For this
        project, I got to work with designer, a business team, data scientists,
        and the project visionary. Everyone had different priorities, areas of
        expertise, and areas where they lacked expertise. We worked together to
        bridge those differences and co-create an awesome project. I am now a
        complete StartUp Weekend Junkie and I canÆt wait for the next one.
