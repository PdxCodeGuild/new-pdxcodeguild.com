        In my class, most days started with an introduction of new topics
        through lecture. We then spent some time in lab, working on programming
        exercises. Most of our programming exercises were individual but we also
        completed exercises using pair programming and in groups. At the end of
        the course, we completed a capstone project, a full stack web
        application that incorporates everything you have learned in this
        course.
