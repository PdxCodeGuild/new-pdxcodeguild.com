      <p class="my-4">
        It really depends on you. We hire the best at Code Guild and we give
        them the freedom to customize their teaching to suite their expertise
        and their student&rsquo;s needs. As such, every class will be a little
        different and every student&rsquo;s experience is going to be a little
        different. In my experience: One of the things that I most appreciated
        about my Code Guild experience is the balance between self directed
        autonomy and support from the school. There hasn&rsquo;t been mandatory
        homework. I never take tests, never submit homework, and have not been
        chastised for not getting something done on time. I have time to
        complete assignments in every class. I have as much support as I need
        during class to complete assignments and access to free tutors outside
        of class if I need additional support. Nothing about the system requires
        me to work outside of class.

        I absolutely do work outside of class. I get the sense that my
        classmates do as well. We are not working to keep up (for the most part)
        nor are we working to hit milestones set by Code Guild. Rather, we are
        incredibly motivated to put together the best work we can. To understand
        concepts inside, outside, backwards and forwards. It took a lot of drive
        and determination to put my life on hold for 3-4 months for a code
        bootcamp. I want to make the most of that. I want to walk away from this
        experience with a portfolio I am proud of. While a Code Guild student, I
        am also working full time, run a non-profit, planning the career fair
        portion of ACT-W, and write for the Code Guild blog. Mandatory homework
        would be really difficult for me to complete. There are days &ndash;
        even weeks &ndash; where all I can give to my studies is the time I am
        in class. I really appreciate that the time in class is enough to
        understand the concepts and put together a solid body of work. I also
        appreciate that, when I do have the time, there are clear
        recommendations on how to use that time to do even better.
