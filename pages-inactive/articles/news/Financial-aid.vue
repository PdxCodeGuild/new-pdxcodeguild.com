      <h2 class="text-3xl my-8">Transparency.</h2>

      <p class="my-4">
        &nbsp; &nbsp;We strive to be as honest and transparent as possible.
        There are no marketing tricks here, but we can still make one promise.
        When you compare the quality of education and price, PDX Code Guild is a
        better value than our competitors. We&rsquo;re authentic, 100% taught
        in-person by qualified instructors, (No class time spent taught by
        videos or T.A.&#39;s!) local, and committed to serving our community.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl my-8">There are 6 main ways to fund tuition.</h2>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">#1: Need-Based Discount</h3>

      <p class="my-4">
        PDX Code Guild offers a very liberal needs-based discount. If your
        yearly household income is approximately 300% or less of the 2019
        federal poverty level. You will qualify on a sliding scale. Sometimes a
        partial discount will be applied to applicants who exceed the income
        guideline if they have circumstances that create need. If you do
        qualify, tuition drops significantly. View the class page to see the
        rage of discounts that apply to each class. How-To Apply: Send an essay
        describing your financial need and any factors that contribute to your
        need for the discount and how you&#39;ll use the education to
        sheri@pdxcodeguild.com.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">#2: Cash pay discount</h3>

      <p class="my-4">
        On occasion, a student will have a portion of their tuition that they
        pay out of pocket. If your out of pocket payment is $1,000 or more and
        you&#39;re able to pay it on or before the first day of class you
        qualify for an additional $500 discount.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">
        #3:
        <a class="text-orange" href="https://pdxcodeguild.skills.fund/"
          >SkillsFund</a
        >
      </h3>

      <p class="my-4">
        SkillsFund is a company that partners with specific, qualified bootcamps
        to offer private loans for tuition. Anyone can apply for this no matter
        his or her income level. The loan interest rates are competitive with
        private tuition loans you&rsquo;d get through your bank, but the benefit
        is you only make principal payments while you&rsquo;re in the bootcamp.
        Skills fund also offers a $7,500 cost of living stipend if you&rsquo;re
        taking the day bootcamp. Principal payments don&rsquo;t start until
        after graduation! Apply: You&rsquo;ll need to be accepted into PDX Code
        Guild before you apply to know how much you&rsquo;ll need to borrow.
        Again, we can walk you through this process.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">#4: Grants</h3>

      <p class="my-4">
        There are numerous 3rd party grants available, and most of our students
        qualify for a grant to help pay tuition. A few of those grants come from
        &bull; WorkSource &bull; Trade Act &bull; Workman&rsquo;s compensation
        &bull; And more. Make an appointment with an advisor to learn
        more.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl my-4">#5: In-House Payments&nbsp;</h3>

      <p class="my-4">
        This option is for those who do not qualify for the need-based discount,
        as the two cannot work together. Pay half tuition, $6,250, before class
        starts and then $125 payments monthly while you&rsquo;re in class until
        you get a job. Once you get a&nbsp;job, payments will be 8% income, or
        $350, whichever is less.<br />
        &nbsp;
