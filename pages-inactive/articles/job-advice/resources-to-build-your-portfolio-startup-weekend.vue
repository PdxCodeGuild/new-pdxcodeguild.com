        Alumni, recruiters, and teachers have each highlighted how important a
        portfolio is to getting hired. At a recent alumni event, I had the
        chance to talk to alums about resources they would recommend to build a
        portfolio in addition to the work that we do in class. Alums recommended
        Hack Oregon, Free Code Camp, and StartUp Weekend.

      <p class="my-4">Code Guild Alums recommend StartUp Weekend because:</p>

      <p class="my-4">
        I actually talked directly to Sheri, the Code Guild director, about
        StartUp Weekend because she was the StartUp Weekend Portland organizer
        for years. She said: &ldquo;I recommend Startup Weekend because
        it&rsquo;s a great opportunity to get a Minimum Viable Product on your
        portfolio in just 54 hours, meet a team of programmers that you may wish
        to continue to code with after the weekend. This will offer more
        portfolio opportunity that includes teamwork skills + code for your
        portfolio. The weekend is sponsored by companies that are hiring tech
        talent and using the weekend as a way to recruit. It also is an
        exhilarating weekend that often leaves participants feeling great about
        what they were able to accomplish; it can be a great confidence
        booster.&rdquo;
