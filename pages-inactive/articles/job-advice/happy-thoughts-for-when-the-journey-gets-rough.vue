        I have had a really good experience at PDX Code Guild. I have a learned
        a lot, met wonderful people, and opened a bunch of options for my
        career. Despite that, it has been stressful at times. Here are five
        great resources to help you chill if the stress gets to you. The Oregon
        Zoo Facebook page posts all sorts of cute animals.
        https://www.facebook.com/oregonzoo/?fref=ts Pep Talk Generator is
        awesome. It serves up a new pep talk whenever you need it.

        and adorable. http://livestream.com/FosterKittenCam/PatiencesKittens The
        To Motivate You tumblr posts motivational quotes.
