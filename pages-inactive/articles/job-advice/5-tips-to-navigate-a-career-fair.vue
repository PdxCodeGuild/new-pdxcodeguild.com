        I find career fairs to be a bit overwhelming. Me being me, I responded
        to that overwhelm by jumping in and learning more! I did a bunch of
        research, organized the career fair for the ACT-W: Women in Tech
        conference, and attended the career fair to support people impacted by
        the Intel lay offs. I am sure there are a few more career fairs in my
        future. The biggest thing I have learned about career fairs is that
        people actually do get hired from them.

      <p class="my-4">
        I graduated from college smack dab in the middle of the &lsquo;08
        recession. At the time, career fairs were non-existent. I have recently
        talked to a number of people who did get hired for tech jobs through
        career fairs. Go to Career Fairs. Every opportunity to job hunt
        increases your chances at getting hired. Research the companies in
        advance. Researching helps you create a plan of attack. Which companies
        do you most want to meet? What are the most valuable few questions you
        can ask?
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        As someone who finds career fairs kind of overwhelming, a plan of attack
        let me set a goal for what I needed to do before I could call the career
        fair a win and go home. Practice your elevator pitch until it is
        comfortable. Ideally, you will get to a point where you can weave your
        elevator pitch into conversation naturally. Dress professionally, bring
        resumes and business cards. Do what you need to get the most out of the
        experience. Some ideas: Take breaks if you need to &ndash; I did. Bring
        your cheering section if you need to &ndash; I saw whole families
        waiting outside the career fair waiting to cheer on their breadwinner.
        Buddy up with a fellow job seeker. Talk to companies you never want to
        work at to get practice and calm down.
