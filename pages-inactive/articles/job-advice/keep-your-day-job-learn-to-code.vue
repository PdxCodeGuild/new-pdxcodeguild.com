        Not everyone can immerse themselves in a full-day bootcamp, which makes
        PDX Code Guild&rsquo;s night class an excellent option for students with
        families or jobs.

        &ldquo;I learned HTML and CSS around 2000, building sites in GoLive and
        Dreamweaver. I took a position at a company using an overseas
        development team. While I gained a lot of experience in writing
        directions, my coding skills atrophied. I realized my knowledge was
        outdated and I desperately needed JavaScript. I had no idea what web
        frameworks like Django were, or how modern non-CMS sites were built.
        I&rsquo;d read reviews of other bootcamps where former students
        complained all they did in class was work thru online tutorials. I knew
        that was not for me. My brain works on a need-to-know-basis. I&rsquo;ve
        gone through programming classes in the past and come out with an
        &ldquo;A&rdquo;, but with no feeling, I&rsquo;d learned something I
        could apply in a real-world project. That&rsquo;s NOT how we roll at PDX
        Code Guild! In the evening Web Development Bootcamp we work on a
        capstone project, almost from week

        1. This allows the student to ask the question first and then seek the
        answer, with plenty of support from the instructor and teaching
        assistant. This is the best way to learn. Find your curiosity and then
        focus is there. And as an added bonus, you get a finished project at the
        end for your portfolio. Would you rather explain to an interviewer how
        many hours you&rsquo;ve spent learning from tutorials, or show a project
        you built from scratch? As I&rsquo;m entering the final month of the
        bootcamp, I&rsquo;m feeling like I&rsquo;ve learned a lot, and I still
        have a ways to go. But I understand the web development landscape now. I
        can code in Python. I&rsquo;ve worked on a Django project. I can write
        JavaScript functions. I wish bootcamp were longer! I feel like
        I&rsquo;ve gotten a taste, and now I want a bigger bite.&rdquo;
