        5 Considerations to Make your Capstone even more A

        Every PDX Code Guild concludes with a capstone which gives students the
        opportunity to reinforce and demonstrate learning. The capstone has been
        one of my favorite parts of my Code Guild experience. I am really
        enjoying creating something and being in a space of more self-directed
        learning. I had the opportunity to attend Demo Day for the previous
        class. I saw some amazing projects and heard from graduates about
        lessons learned.

      <p class="my-4">
        The most impressive projects were visually striking. They included
        photography and clean interfaces. Scale your MVP down to the smallest
        possible MVP &ndash; then scale it down again. Four weeks is not a lot
        of time to put together a beautiful, functional, non-glitchy, project
        that has been deployed the server. The most successful projects start
        with a small project and stay focused on that until the MVP is done.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        <strong class="text-xl">Deploy as early as possible. </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Deployed projects made for more impressive demos on demo day.
        Additionally, deploying can be one of the trickier parts of the project.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        <strong class="text-xl"
          >Research the API you plan to use before committing to a project idea.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Some APIs are free to use with great documentation. Others are extremely
        expensive. Others won&rsquo;t grant access. Projects that rely on a
        particular API can get significantly delayed by negotiating with a
        particular API. Craft a project that includes a database, Django, and
        Javascript. Code Guild sets the expectation that students will
        incorporate a full stack in their capstone project. The project will
        need to include a&nbsp;database and front end interaction.
