        Consider us at the PDX Code Guild both impressed and proud
      </h2>

      <p class="my-4">
        We had 3 of our current students and two Code Guild graduates
        participate in the weekend, as well as 2 of our Advisors. PDXShelter, a
        team led by PDX Code Guild student Matthew Fountain and aided by
        schoolmate Ryan Perkins was the top winner of the evening. Their social
        enterprise startup, an app designed to bring real time shelter
        information to the homeless, took both Best Overall and Best Customer
        Validation. The team contacted and worked with several homeless shelters
        around the city, learning and listening. The team found that most of the
        homeless either have a smart phone, or access to one &ndash; making the
        real time information useful and priceless. The end result is a mobile
        app with a mapping tool, which provides real time answers to whether
        there&rsquo;s a bed for them to sleep in, if they accept pets, and all
        essential information to those living on the street. Fourteen different
        teams presented their MVP&rsquo;s (minimum viable products) at Portland
        Startup Weekend. TinkleTime, a sensor which attaches to diapers, was
        awarded Best Business Model. SmartStream &ndash; a device created to
        monitor E. Coli levels in water in real-time won the award for Best
        Execution.
