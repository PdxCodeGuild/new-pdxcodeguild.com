        I see this question popping more and more. Before you answer the
        question, you should be aware of decomposition. It is a skill
        programmers use to solve complex problems. You take a big problem and
        break it into more manageable smaller problems. So letÆs try this on the
        question we are asking: ôShould I quit my job for a code boot camp?ö
        WeÆre are in fact asking two questions: Should I quit my job? Should I
        do a coding bootcamp? Should I quit my job? Do you have six months of
        salary saved up? Well this is pretty easyà do you have at least six
        months of salary saved? If not, you should reconsider. Quitting your job
        without an alternative source of income is a questionable move at best.
        If you do, then great for you! A word of caution though: Your job search
        could take up to six months. This depends on the skills you learn, how
        fast you learn them, and your prior experience. Should I attend a coding
        bootcamp? Have you ever written code before (even just a single line)?
        There are tons of online sites that can help you get the basics of
        programming. Try them before you commit to three months of non-stop
        coding. CodeCademy and TreeHouse are great resources when first starting
        out. Do you like programming? So assuming you have tried coding to a
        degree, do you like it? YouÆre going to be coding for at least 6 hours a
        day. Are you ready for that? Try coding after a long day of work. If you
        find yourself having fun even after an exhausting day you will likely be
        able to handle it. Am I ready for a coding bootcamp? Coding boot camps
        take up a lot of time. Can you devote enough time to complete the
        school? At most schools youÆre coding or in class for about 8 hours a
        day. You will have assignments and homework on top of that.
        Additionally, to get the most out of it you will want to study on top of
        that. DonÆt plan to do much else during your code boot camp. Well should
        I? All that aside, it comes down to discipline and motivation. If youÆre
        disciplined enough to be financially stable. YouÆre probably going to be
        fine. But, if youÆre leaving your job for more money, or because youÆre
        currently unhappy. DonÆt do it. Admittedly, most of this article has
        been giving reasons of why you shouldnÆt. But if you enjoy learning or
        have always been technical and want to take your skills to the next
        level. Code schools are for people like you. It is going to be one of
        the most fulfilling ventures of your life and youÆre going to love it!
        Good Luck!
