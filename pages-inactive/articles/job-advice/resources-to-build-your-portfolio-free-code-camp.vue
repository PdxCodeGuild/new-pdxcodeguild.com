        Resources to Build your Portfolio: Free Code Camp

        Alumni, recruiters, and teachers have each highlighted how important a
        portfolio is to getting hired. At a recent alumni event, I had the
        chance to talk to alums about resources they would recommend to build a
        portfolio in addition to the work that we do in class.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Alums recommended Hack Oregon, Free Code Camp, and StartUp Weekend.

        >
        Mission Statement: Free Code Camp is a community of 200,000+ developers.
        Students learn to code and learn full stack JavaScript. They build a
        portfolio of apps that solve real problems for nonprofits.
      </p>

        What does participation look like: &ldquo;Once you finish the first
        three certifications, you&rsquo;ll get to build a series of solutions
        for nonprofits. You&rsquo;ll work in pairs, under the supervision of a
        volunteer project manager and a stakeholder from the nonprofit.&rdquo;

        Code Guild Alums recommend Free Code Camp because: &ldquo;I loved it
        though. It is refreshing and a nice change from video tutorials. I enjoy
        coding challenges and Free Code Camp adds the certificates as an
        incentive. . . (and) The exercises are challenging.&rdquo; Micheal
