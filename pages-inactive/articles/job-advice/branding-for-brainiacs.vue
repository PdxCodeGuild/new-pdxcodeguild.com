      <p class="my-4">This great workshop!</p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Join us for Branding For Brainiacs November 6th, 6:30pm @ PDX Code Guild
        Seats are limited; RSVP Here Startup founders rule. You are ready to
        reinvent the world with your brilliant idea for a startup. But to get
        your business off the ground you need to connect with customers. You
        need a brand. A brand is what the outside world thinks of you.
        It&rsquo;s communicated in everything you do &ndash; from how you answer
        the phone, to the colors on your homepage, to the logo on your door. You
        need to figure out what you stand for and how that walks and talks. Your
        customers may care less about the nuts and bolts of your business than
        your colors.
