        5 Tips to Prepare for a Technical Interview
      </h1>

      <p class="my-4">
        Technical interviews are somewhat unique to the programming world. They
        can include whiteboarding, knowledge-based questions, and brain teasers.
        Technical interviews are designed to test technical knowledge and how
        you handle pressure.

          >Technical interviews are a space that give partial credit &ndash; get
          all the credit you can by following the following tips.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        <strong class="text-xl">Stay Calm</strong>. Remember that one of the big
        things these interviews are designed to assess is how you deal with
        pressure and not knowing the answer. They will often get progressively
        harder specifically to get you into a space where you don&rsquo;t know
        the answer. Don&rsquo;t argue with the interviewer about the quality of
        the question.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        <strong class="text-xl">Don&rsquo;t refuse to answer</strong>. Ask
        clarifying questions and for context as needed. This demonstrates that
        you are comfortable asking for help, allows you to have a dialogue with
        the interviewer, and gain context if you aren&rsquo;t certain what is
        being asked. Walk the interviewer through your thought process. If you
        know the answer, it is important to show how you got to the answer. If
        you don&rsquo;t know the answer, talk the interviewer through what you
        do know and how it applies to the question or how you would go about
        getting the answer.

        demonstrate that you understand the underlying logic but can&rsquo;t
        remember the syntax than to leave the question on the table. Practice
        the following phrases. Practicing how you will handle getting stumped is
        a good way to ensure that you keep a cool head when it happens. I
        don&rsquo;t know but here is how I would get the answer. . . I am
        excited to learn more about that topic. Here is how I would go about
