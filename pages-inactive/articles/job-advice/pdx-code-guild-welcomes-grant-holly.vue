        The Guild is growing! We&rsquo;re so excited to announce that Grant
        Holly is joining our Instructing team!
      </h2>

      <p class="my-4">
        Grant has an extensive teaching background. Most recently, he was a
        technical trainer and consultant. (That basically means he got to fly
        around and teach people how to use new technology and help them
        integrate it into their systems.) When we asked him to share a bit about
        himself, he said: &quot;<em
          >Some of my areas of expertise are databases, analytics,
          visualization, application development and support, and then throw in
          some networking, security, and admin stuff, sprinkle in a bit of
          hacking and that&rsquo;s me&quot;</em
        >.
      </p>

        It&rsquo;s a big fun mess. If you want to get to know this &ldquo;big
        fun mess,&rdquo; check out this post, or find him at our Junior
        Developer Bootcamp and Monday Python Flying Circus.

          >Why are you passionate about teaching web development, specifically
          Python?</strong
        >
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        &nbsp;I&rsquo;m passionate about teaching first and foremost. Teaching
        web development is great because you get to see students make something
        that they can actually use. Web technology is also pervasive and in the
        forefront of our culture. Being able to dissect and understand the
        different working parts, well, let&rsquo;s just say you&rsquo;ll never
        see the web, or the world the same. For people with little or no
        exposure to coding, the idea of working on prime number factorization or
        sorting algorithms doesn&rsquo;t have the same appeal as, say,
        &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make a web page where we can vote on and recommend
        everyone&rsquo;s favorite bands.&rdquo; Concerning Python, I think
        Python is a fun language to learn first. (To prove it, if you have
        Python &ndash; and you probably do &ndash; type &ldquo;import
        antigravity&rdquo; into the interactive prompt for a relevant XKCD. For
        the less adventurous, check out https://xkcd.com/353/.)
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        On a more serious note, traditionally a lot of Computer Science is
        taught bottom up. Students typically learn C/C++/Java, and they study
        compilers, a healthy dose of mathematics, they might even do some
        assembly code, then it&rsquo;s on to algorithms, data structures, before
        they dive deeply into higher level languages like Python. This bottom up
        approach tends to have a high burn out rate or seems too intimidating.
        Being an interpreted language, Python obscures a lot of that for new
        programmers. It is a great language because of its human readability and
        clean syntax, which makes it amazingly approachable. For someone who has
        never written a line of code before, being able to watch your first
        program run is an exciting experience that more people should have.

        <strong class="text-xl">Why should someone join the Guild? </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        You should join the Guild because you are a self-motivator and are
        ambitious. I think the kind of person that is drawn to PDX Code Guild is
        someone who has maybe tried learning coding, or some other facet of
        computing, on their own, but they want to go to the next level and take
        a really deep dive. People want to learn how to think like a programmer
        more than just parrot what other people do, and that can be hard to
        learn on your own without any guidance or mentor-ship. PDX Code Guild
        really stands out because we give people current industry dev skills,
        but also teach systems-thinking, how to reason programmatically.
        Additionally we don&rsquo;t just teach students to use today&rsquo;s
        technology, but to create it and make it their own.

          >What&rsquo;s the best part of Portland&rsquo;s Technology Industry?
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        What stands out in my mind the most compared to the tech scene in other
        cities like San Francisco and Seattle is how welcoming and inclusive the
        community is here. For Portland&rsquo;s size, there are a lot of really
        great active groups and meet-ups. I think that user groups can be really
        intimidating, or rather, there might be the expectation that they are
        unduly academic or technical, but here in Portland the community is very
        approachable and inviting to everyone.

        >
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Where do I begin? I have lived in the NW most of my life, so I think
        I&rsquo;m kind of spoiled. Having traveled quite a bit, I was always
        happy to see Mt. Hood on my approach back into beautiful Oregon. My
        short list of what I love about Portland is our unique, open culture and
        general &ldquo;be yourself, especially if you are weird.&rdquo; I also
        love being close to everything (wine country, mountains, the ocean, the
        Columbia, the forest, just to name a few.) And, when it comes to this
        city, I can&rsquo;t leave out eating out in Portland &ndash; and
        it&rsquo;s not too hard on my wallet. Nowhere I&rsquo;ve been beats
        dining in Portland.
