        I talked with CTO, Chris Jones, about the experience of students after
        their bootcamp experience. Code Guild is in the process of compiling
        official data on student outcomes. In the meantime, Chris has mentored
        and tutored every class since the first class with which he graduated.
        In ChrisÆs experience, people who are dedicated to finding a job
        typically find a job. A month gap in between graduation and getting
        hired is typical. He recommends coding daily and alums dedicating
        themselves to finding a job as if it was their job. Code Guild supports
        students in their transition by providing continuous education support.
        Students are encouraged to continue spending time at Code Guild for the
        continued accountability and support. Most of the main building is
        dedicated to offering a comfortable space for students to continue their
        learning. Code Guild recently hired a teacher whose entire focus will be
        continuous education. Alums can continue to get their code related
        questions answered. Sheri, the head of Code Guild, has also offered to
        do a review of alumsÆ cover letter, resume, and social media to support
        them in finding a job. Meetups gather at Code Guild in the evening which
        give alums the opportunity to network, contribute to projects, and ask
        questions. Alison Acuna
