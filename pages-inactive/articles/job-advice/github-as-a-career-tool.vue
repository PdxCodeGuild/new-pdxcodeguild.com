      <h2 class="text-3xl my-8">What is GitHub?</h2>

      <p class="my-4">
        GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It is used: As a
        cloud based backup for coding projects. To save versions of a project.
        To aid collaborations and open source projects. As proof that a job
        seeker can code. How is GitHub used as a career tool? A GitHub account
        can be used in conjunction with a LinkedIn profile, portfolio, and
        resume. Portfolio: More visually impressive and helpful for people who
        aren&rsquo;t technical. GitHub: Helpful for a technical person who can
        use it to determine skill level. Resume: Demonstrates work experience.
        LinkedIn: Demonstrates personal brand and work experience github The
        first person you will likely talk to when interviewing for developer
        jobs will likely be not as technical and will not be likely to look at
        your GitHub account. At the point you talk to an engineer, they will
        look at your github, your linkedin, and your resume. GitHub demonstrates
        both skill level and growth. It showcases what you know. It also
        showcases how quickly you can learn and that you are capable of
        learning. Check back on Thursday for 5 steps to a better GitHub Profile.
