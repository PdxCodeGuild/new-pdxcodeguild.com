        Have you ever had a business idea but didn&rsquo;t have the tech knowhow
        to get moving?
      </h2>

      <p class="my-4">
        More and more businesses want to incorporate web apps into their
        offerings, so PDX Code Guild is partnering with Portland Startup Weekend
        to offer the winner a development services package to help new business
        create their prototype. The PDX Code Guild team will help business
        founders further define what their app is, who will use it, and how it
        should work. After drafting some requirements, the PDX Code Guild team
        will start to put pen to paper, or rather, code to text editors, and
        build a prototype.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        This provides startup founders with valuable knowledge of the technical
        scope of their app, as well as give them insight into how their app will
        work and what it will take to launch it. For the PDX Code Guild
        students, this gives them more hands-on learning and experience.
        &ldquo;We think that one of the best ways of learning to code, is
        working on a project,&rdquo; says Instructor and developer Grant Holly.
        &ldquo;Our prize package is a win-win for startup founders and for our
        students who get &lsquo;real-world&rsquo; hands-on experience not just
        coding, but the software development process,&rdquo; he adds. If you are
        interested in learning the craft of coding, PDX Code Guild is offering
        an immersive 12 week session starting Jan 5th for the day class, and Jan
        26th for the 16 week night class. Check out PDXcodeguild.com for
        details, or come by for one of their meetups on Monday night at 6.
