        Luke Hammer: Family Man and Code Guild Alum
      </h1>
      <!-- body -->

      <p class="my-4">
        Luke is a family man. He was a fairly typical college student &ndash;
        pursuing a BA in Communications and smitten with his college sweetheart.
        Luke and his sweetheart, Toni, decided to get married.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        They couldn&rsquo;t afford to both be in school at the same time so Luke
        dropped out to support his young wife as she finished her BA. A few
        years later, Toni had graduated and Luke was working nights for UPS. He
        was able to return to school and finish out his BA. By this time, they
        had two little ones and Luke was committed to providing a good life for
        his children. After 6 months of job hunting, it was clear that the BA
        was not paying off with a job.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        Luke enrolled in the night class at Code Guild. In speaking with Luke, I
        was incredibly impressed by his grit and determination. He worked,
        attended classes, was an active and involved Dad, and was diagnosed with
        diabetes. A typical day for Luke during this period looked like: 1pm
        Take kids to the park 2:30 Drive to Work 3pm Start work 5pm Drive to
        Code Guild 5:30 &ndash; 9:30 Code Guild 10pm &ndash; 4 am Finish Work
        After graduating from Code Guild, Luke interviewed with a wide range of
        companies. He walked away from an option to make 60k working in Salem.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        He chose to work at Multnomah University because Multnomah University:
        Offers the flexibility which allows him to better connect with his
        family. Supports his continued learning. Ensures that the work he does
        contributes to a cause he believes in. Code Guild equipped Luke with
        skills that are valuable in the market which gave him the freedom to
        chose to work for an organization he believes in. Luke says the impact
        of Code Guild is that:<em>
          &ldquo;I look different. I feel and I look younger. My soul has
          recovered from being slowly poked. I hated being a part of a big
          organization where I couldn&rsquo;t make an impact. Now &ndash; I push
          something and it moves! I can make significant changes
          here.&rdquo;</em
